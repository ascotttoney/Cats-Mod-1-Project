# Module One Final Project

## ATLANTA CAT DIRECTORY
#### by: Deka Ambia & Scott Toney


### Overview
This Ruby CLI application is a simple, three-model program where you can view, add, edit, and delete both cats and owners from a neighborhood directory. Given the choice between an API scraper or a CLI CRUD application, we chose the latter. With the help of ActiveRecord, we wrote migration files that created our models, a seed file that provided us with sample data, and a controller file that contained all of our methods.


### Instructions
In Terminal, navigate to the Cats-Mod-1-Project folder. Once there, run `bundle`. To start the program, run `ruby bin/run.rb`. Once inside, use the menus to complete your desired taks.
